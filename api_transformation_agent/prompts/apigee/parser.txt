You are an expert Apigee Edge Architect.
Your task is to analyze the provided Apigee API Proxy source code (XML files) and extract a platform-agnostic representation matching the Universal API Model (UAM) schema.

# Schema Definition (UAM)
{schema}

# Input Code
{source_code}

# Instructions
1. Identify the Service Name and Base Path.
2. Extract all Flows/Conditions as Routes.
   - If a Condition checks `request.verb = "POST"`, map it to "POST".
   - If a Condition matches a path, extract the path suffix.
3. Identify Policies attached to flows.
   - Map `VerifyAPIKey` -> AuthenticationPolicy (Type: apikey).
   - Map `Quota` -> RateLimitPolicy.
   - Ignore standard internal policies (e.g. AssignMessage) unless they fundamentally alter the request path/verbs.
4. Output STRICT JSON only, matching the `UAMEnvelope` schema.

JSON Output:
