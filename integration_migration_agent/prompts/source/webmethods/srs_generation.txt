Your task is to analyze the provided {system_name} Service files (XML/Java/Flow) and generate a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS).

CONTEXT:
{context_str}

SOURCE FILES:
{source_code}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a Markdown SRS with:
1.  **Overview**: Purpose of the integration service.
2.  **Input/Output**: Data structures defined.
3.  **Flow Logic**: Step-by-step logic (mapping, transformation, routing).
4.  **External Calls**: Database, API, or Adapter calls identifying.
